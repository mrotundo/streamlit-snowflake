# Banking Agents Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully redesigned the banking agents (CustomerAnalyticsAgent, LoanPortfolioAgent, DepositAnalyticsAgent, TransactionInsightsAgent) to work with real database data instead of mock data.

## Key Changes

### 1. New SQL Query Tools Created
- **CustomerQueryTool**: Executes customer segmentation, CLV, churn risk, and demographic queries
- **LoanQueryTool**: Executes loan portfolio, performance, risk, and vintage analysis queries
- **DepositQueryTool**: Executes deposit balance, growth, liquidity, and activity queries
- **TransactionQueryTool**: Executes transaction pattern, anomaly, cash flow, and behavioral queries

### 2. New Analysis Tools Created
- **AnalyzeCustomerSegmentsTool**: Analyzes customer segments for growth opportunities, retention strategies, and product recommendations
- **AnalyzeLoanPortfolioTool**: Analyzes loan portfolio for risk assessment, performance review, and vintage analysis
- **AnalyzeDepositTrendsTool**: Analyzes deposit trends for growth, stability, and rate sensitivity
- **AnalyzeTransactionPatternsTool**: Analyzes transaction patterns for behavioral insights, fraud detection, and spending analysis

### 3. Agent Updates
- Renamed agents to better reflect their analytics focus:
  - CustomerAgent → CustomerAnalyticsAgent
  - LoanAgent → LoanPortfolioAgent  
  - DepositAgent → DepositAnalyticsAgent
  - Added new TransactionInsightsAgent
- Updated all agents to use real data tools instead of mock tools
- Fixed tool initialization to use correct `_initialize_tools` method
- Ensured proper output formatting for analysis results

### 4. Response Formatting
- Updated all analysis tools to return results in expected format:
  ```json
  {
    "analysis": {
      "answer": "Main answer text",
      "insights": ["insight 1", "insight 2"],
      "recommendations": ["recommendation 1", "recommendation 2"]
    }
  }
  ```
- Added `_format_raw_data_response` to base agent for queries that don't use analysis tools
- Fixed output key naming to ensure proper response formatting

### 5. Plan Execution Improvements
- Fixed adaptations to always be a dictionary (not string)
- Added validation in create_plan methods
- Ensured final analysis steps use "analysis" as output_key

## Current Status

### Working Features
✅ All agents successfully route queries based on keywords
✅ SQL query tools execute against real database
✅ Analysis tools format responses properly
✅ Raw data queries show formatted results
✅ Agent registry properly initializes data-driven agents

### Known Issues
⚠️ Some analysis queries may timeout with large datasets (need to implement data limiting)
⚠️ Token limits may be exceeded when passing too much data to analysis tools

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize agent
agent = agent_registry.create_agent("CustomerAnalyticsAgent")

# Process query
response = agent.process(
    query="Show me customer segmentation breakdown",
    llm_service=llm_service,
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Response includes formatted analysis with insights and recommendations
print(response["response"])
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement data limiting in query tools to prevent token limit issues
2. Add data visualization capabilities
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. Add more sophisticated analysis patterns
5. Create cross-agent query capabilities
